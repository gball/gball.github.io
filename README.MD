Gobind Singh Ball - Personal Website


Description
___________

I wanted to create a personal website for people to get to know me better and my skills!
I used AngularJs, HTML5, CSS3, and a Google spreadsheet as a lightweight database. Using a 
google spreadsheet, it will allow me to update, add, or delete information without having to go 
in the code base. The project is fully reponsive and I did NOT use bootstrap! :) Even though 
it is a small project, I tested it using Jasmine and Karma. Testing is important and it even 
helped me clean code on this project! I got code coverage of 95%, and the results can be seen 
under the test/coverage folder. If you have any questions or want to chat, please feel free to 
contact me at gobindball32@gmail.com. Have a fantastic rest of your week! Happy coding! :D
